# Triage Labels

The skills speak in terms of five canonical triage roles. This file maps those roles to the actual label strings used in this repo's issue tracker.

| Label in mattpocock/skills | Label in our tracker | Meaning                                  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `needs-triage`             | `needs-triage`       | Maintainer needs to evaluate this issue  |
| `needs-info`               | `needs-info`         | Waiting on reporter for more information |
| `ready-for-agent`          | `ready-for-agent`    | Fully specified, ready for an AFK agent  |
| `ready-for-human`          | `ready-for-human`    | Requires human implementation            |
| `wontfix`                  | `wontfix`            | Will not be actioned                     |

When a skill mentions a role (e.g. "apply the AFK-ready triage label"), use the corresponding label string from this table.

Edit the right-hand column to match whatever vocabulary you actually use. The
labels must exist in the repo before a skill applies them
(`gh label create <name>` for any missing one).

## Additional state labels

`.github/workflows/maintenance.yml` also knows these labels. They sit next to
the five roles and describe who is on an issue, not whether it is specified.

| Label         | Meaning                                                                                              |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `in-progress` | Someone is on the issue, at any stage (grill, spec, build). Pickers such as `/next` skip it.          |
| `in-review`   | A ready pull request waits on a human reviewer. Exclusive with `in-progress` and `needs-human`.       |
| `needs-human` | An agent parked: a numbered list of questions waits in the issue comments. Exclusive with `ready-for-agent`. |
| `tracking`    | Spec split into child tickets. Not grabbable — the work is the children. Closes when they all close. |

`/to-tickets` applies `tracking` to the parent spec after publishing the
children and removes `in-progress` from it. `/next` and `/triage` never serve a
`tracking` issue as actionable work.

## Exit convention: labels are stripped on close

Closing an issue is the terminal state. The maintenance workflow removes every
live state label (`needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`,
`ready-for-human`, `tracking`, `in-progress`, `needs-human`, `in-review`) from
each closed issue; `wontfix` stays as the closing reason. It runs on every
issue close and on manual dispatch, so a missed event self-heals on the next
run. Agents never strip these labels themselves.
